# Support for RPCS3 was added just in time for *Return to Boletaria*!

Greetings fellows undead, bearers of the curse, ashen ones, hunters and now *slayers of demons*!

As it was [previously announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/SummonSign/comments/iwn8lx/are_you_ready_to_take_jolly_cooperation_to/) we are now working to add support for the upcoming Demon's Souls Remake and next gen consoles to r/SummonSign.

While the promised day of Demon's Souls Remake release doesn't comme lets enjoy one more time the world of Boletaria, we've added support for the PS3 emulation software RPCS3 and Demon's Souls to r/SummonSign.

You can use now r/SummonSign to play and arrange matches for Demon's Souls on the **PS3**(private server) and on pc using **RPCS3**(PS3 emulation software).

Additional Instructions as follows:

> You must include in the **title** the [*type of submission*] **and** your [*platform*].

> e.g., [*Help*][PS4][100] Abyss Watchers

> or

> e.g., [*Help*][RPCS3][100][DeS] Tower Kinght

### Accepted values for [*type of submission*] and [*platform*], one of either:
Type of submission | and | Platform
:---:|:---:|:----:
Help | - | PS4/**PS3**
Summon | - | **RPCS3**^(*new)
Co-op | - | PC/Steam
PvP | - | Xbox/Xbone/Xbox1/Xbox360
 - | - | Switch

And don't forget that while [Game], [Soul Level], [Weapon Upgrade Level],  Area,  Boss Name, or (Password) in the title *are optional* information; we strongly suggest that at least you add the [Game] and [Boss] to your title to make your thread easier to read for those that are willing to help.

A substantial amount of code had to be rewritten to make these changes so if something unexpected happens or if something else is not working as intended please let me know ASAP.
