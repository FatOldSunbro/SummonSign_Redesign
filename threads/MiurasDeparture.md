I'm sorry but this is such BS and just hardly any good modding.

People are mourning and paying their respects all over the place, from [r/manga](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/ngozw5/news_kentaro_miura_author_of_berserk_has_passed/) to [r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ngzohf/final_fantasy_14_players_gather_to_pay_respect_to/?ref=share&ref_source=link) you can find posts about Miura's death because that's how much influencial his work is.

This is specially true in the Souls community since of how much both works are intertwined, it is known that Hidetaka Miyazaki hinself is a fan and how much the fanbase overlaps with each other.

> Please keep any further posts or thoughts regarding Kentaro Miura's death to this thread or one of the few older threads that may still be floating around on the subreddit, just to keep things in order.

I can understand that you guys want to limit and remove any *further* threads regarding this topic to avoid the subreddit being flooded, but going to the extend of straight up *remove* and *locking* any previous thread is just mind boggling.

This subreddit already is far from the thriving place that used to be and now it is a collection of low effort daily posts that are always the same *("my first [...] run", "I've beat DS", "what is the best weapon for...")* and don't generate any real discussion, it was taylored to this state.

I'm sure you guys(u/e_0, u/KrisErra, u/N3DSdude ...) have good intentions but really aren't doing any good by alienating this community. I hope you all can reconsider your decision and restore the previous posts. If you got all the way down here thanks for reading, cheers.

Following your previous message:

>That conversation is not happening there. I'm tired of having anything meta-related to the subreddit be shit on by you and SquareWheel both because you disagree with how things are being run. 

>Despite our differences and the fact that we split up, I don't do the same thing to /r/DarkSouls3. That's their area, and I don't touch it - they can run things how they wish. I don't do that to /r/Summonsign either, a subreddit you moderate. I don't do that to /r/GameDeals, a subreddit SquareWheel moderates. 

>It would be a different story if there wasn't so much hostility and dog-piling with these sorts of things, but there always seems to be one way or another, and it's frustrating. It can't be "Hey can we do x instead of y? I think it would be more beneficial." 

>It's always "Wow, such BS, bad moderating, you're killing things, you're awful" with *sometimes* some constructive discussion going on - but that constructive material is always overshadowed by the shit slinging. If you have something you'd like to propose or discuss, you can do so without insulting the moderator team. 

>I wouldn't have any issues with "posting this here" and discussing things on the megathread if it was constructive only, but it never is, so that conversation isn't happening there. If you have any further questions or want to make any suggestions, you can do it here or in the moderator mail if you'd like for the entirety of the team to see it and weigh in on your thoughts.

I've been part of the reddit souls community for many years now and this is literally the very first time that I've expressed my concerns against decisions made by you guys.

I am under the impression that you think I am someone that I am not. I have nothing and never had anything to do with r/DS3 or squarewheel, I am only the moderator of r/SummonSign because I am an active player and use that sub all the time and I had volunteered to become mod last time when it was needed followed by whatever debacle that it was the split of the old team, since I didn't want it to die.

Sure I mighty have used harsh words(if thats how you feel about BS) and pay attention to this: I am not saying that you guys are bad moderators what I stand by and am saying is that **removing previous threads is the wrong decision here**.

*All I was asking is to you guys reconsider and at least restore the [most upvoted relevant thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/ngscnh/the_author_of_berserk_kentaro_miura_has_passed/).*

**Is that so unreasonable?**

You guys ask to keep things to existing threads at the same time as removing them, the way this is done even if people just want to read they can't because now this thread is not indexed anymore, *these are exceptional* news and they should remain archived in the subrredit history.

Lastly pardon my english, it is not my native tongue and even thought I have thought I was expressing myself in a proper way your reply makes me feel not. Nothing here is personal or to be considered as an attack to you, honestly whatever the hell it was the falling apart of the old team this sucks since this have tainted the community so much that just by expressing my concerns you would think so.

BTW I'm not one of those against the later changes that people shouldn't be able to post memes or whatever shitpost they want, my point is exactly the opposite, you guys are still too heavy on the hammer removing any post that slightly don't fit your world view and therefore snuffing any possibility of different discussions that's what I mean by *alienating the community*, this is a subreddit for 10 years old game do you guys have to be so stiff all the time? Well I said my piece take whatever you want from this, cheers.
