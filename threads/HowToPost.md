### Award +karma to the people that helped you!
This subreddit has a custom karma count in the format of a user flair, it is the "+number" that you see next to your username.

After your request is fulfilled and somebody have helped you it is expected that you award them with "+karma".

To give karma all you need to do is to reply to one of the comments of the person that helped you with the keyword **+karma**.

### Comment +complete to your own thread to change flairs to Duty Fulfilled
After your request is complete you can change the flair of your thread to "Duty Fulfilled" so people know that you were already helped.

You can manually change the flair by editing your post flair

Or

You can also change your submission flair by simply commenting on your own thread with the keyword: **+complete**

Remember that for this to work you must be the original submitter and it must a top level comment.

### What games can I use this subreddit for?
You can use this sub to find online play for any of the following games in the Souls Series:

> Demon's Souls and Demon's Souls Remastered

> Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered

> Dark Souls II

> Dark Souls III

### What about Bloodborne?
Please use r/huntersbell for online play in BLoodborne.

### Trading items / Can somebody give me (x) item/souls?
Trading or request for items are not allowed here because there is a dedicated subreddit for that:

> For Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered use r/snuggly

> For Dark Souls 2 use r/wheelanddeal

> For Dark Souls 3 use r/pumparum

### Is there a community password? / What password should I use?
In DSIII, DSR and **probably** DeSR?! is possible to use a password to match between players.

With a password you can bypass any soul level, weapon upgrade and game cycle requirements, in other words you can match with anyone if both parties are using the same password.

You can set a password in:

> Options -> Network Settings -> Password

Also make sure you are online and have matchmaking set to "ON/Global"

We do not have any "community password" as using a password without previous arrangement would probably only limit your online experience, but since this is an international community we **strongly** suggest that you keep things simple and use an **easy to write** password:

A good password should be:

* all lowercase

* single word

* with 4 or less letters

Example:

>...lets meet at the bonfire, use the password **help**.

We suggest that you use the word "help" as your password as it fits all the requirements above and it is a word recognizable all around the world.
