### Hello there, everyone!

I would like to announce some news and changes to the moderation team, up to now the moderation team was composed by 3 human moderators, one went MIA some time back to never be heard again and now u/soulofascrubcasul is retiring from his duties as a moderator.

And so I am now opening new moderation application for those who are interested, here is what we are looking in a moderator:

**Requirements to be a moderator:**

* An active account in the soulsborne community.

* Account must be older than 3 months and have positive karma.

**Responsibilities of a moderator:**

* Help users who might have trouble making new submissions on r/SummonSign.

* Help keep the subreddit organized and remove/redirect offtopic submissions, such as trade request.

* Actively checking the moderator queue, and processing the reports/red flags.

* Using discretion and a level head when dealing with arguments/insults within the subreddit.

* Remaining unbiased, and professional when participating within the subreddit.

**Benefits of being a moderator:**

* None.

r/SummonSign is a low maintenance subreddit, so most of the time what you actually have to do is to help users confused by the title requirements make new submissions, redirect trade submissions to their correct subreddit and eventually every once in a while deal with troll accounts.

### If you agree with these terms and wishes to become a member of the moderator team you can apply [HERE](https://forms.gle/1yXbcqdKMwDMEQCc7) - the applications will be open until May 25th.

Before signing off I would like to take this chance to thank and wish success to soulofascrubcasul, rafajafar(author of the current karma bot) and all previous mods for their help and contribution into building this awesome community that you all are part of!!

If you have any questions or concerns you can post them below and I will reply as soon as I can.

Thank you all for reading and being a member of r/SummonSign - Praise the Sun \\`[T] /
