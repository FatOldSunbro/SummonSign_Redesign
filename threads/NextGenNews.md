### You can now comment +complete to your thread to change flairs to Duty Fulfilled
We also have a new feature, as you may or may not know, depending of what reddit client you use, mobile, old, new... changing flairs might not be the most intuitive thing to do and so now after your request is done and you wish to close your thread you can use the keyword "+complete" to change the flair to "Duty Fulfilled".

To change the flair all you need to do is to comment as a reply to your own thread with the keyword **+complete**, and your flair will be automatically changed to "Duty Fulfilled".

Thank you for your understanding and co-operation in creating an enjoyable gaming environment for all.
