Submission titles must use the format above, and must include at least the request type and platform. All others will be removed by the bot!

Add additional information as necessary in the body of your post (e.g., 'Looking for teammates in the arena').

When complete, please tag your post Duty Fulfilled! to let others know you don't need help/aren't available for summons/co-op/arena matches any longer.

You may award karma to another user by posting a comment reply with the text: +karma

Karma can only be awarded once per post, per player interaction

You can only award karma to a comment reply (must not be the first comment made by the helper!)

The player granting karma must either be the same as the post submitter (for Summon/Co-op requests), or, the comment being replied to must have been made by the submitter (for Help requests)

Set "Cross-region play" to "Matchmaking ON"

Make sure your passwords match

Set "Summon sign visibility" to "Unrestricted"

Set "Voice chat" to "Allowed" (if desired)

Make sure you let your new friend(s) know if they will see your Online ID or character name (this will help avoid confusion if someone else happens to use the same password).
